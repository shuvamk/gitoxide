//! Git stores all of its data as _Objects_, which are data along with a hash over all data. Thus it's an
//! object store indexed by the signature of data itself with inherent deduplication: the same data will have the same hash,
//! and thus occupy the same space within the store.
//!
//! There is only one all-round object store, also known as the [`Store`], as it supports ~~everything~~ most of what git has to offer.
//!
//! * loose object reading and writing
//! * access to packed objects
//! * multiple loose objects and pack locations as gathered from `alternates` files.
//!
//! ## Write And Read Loose Objects
//!
//! ```
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
//! # mod doctest { include!(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/tests/doctest.rs")); }
//! use gix_object::{FindExt, Write};
//!
//! let (_dir, odb) = doctest::empty_store()?;
//! let id = odb.write_buf(gix_object::Kind::Blob, b"hello")?;
//!
//! let mut buf = Vec::new();
//! let object = odb.find(&id, &mut buf)?;
//! assert_eq!(object.kind, gix_object::Kind::Blob);
//! assert_eq!(object.data, b"hello");
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Inspect Headers Without Decoding The Object
//!
//! ```
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
//! # mod doctest { include!(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/tests/doctest.rs")); }

//!
//! let (_dir, odb) = doctest::empty_store()?;

///
/// - creating an instance does not scan the object directory unless
///   [`Slots::AsNeededByDiskState`][store::init::Slots::AsNeededByDiskState] is used.
/// - multi-threaded lazy-loading of indices and packs
/// - per-thread pack and object caching avoiding cache trashing.
/// - most-recently-used packs are always first for speedups if objects are stored in the same pack, typical for packs organized by
///   commit graph and object age.
/// - lock-free reading for perfect scaling across all cores, and changes to it don't affect readers as long as these don't want to
///   enter the same branch.
/// - sync with the state on disk if objects aren't found to catch up with changes if an object seems to be missing.
///    - turn off the behaviour above for all handles if objects are expected to be missing due to spare checkouts.
